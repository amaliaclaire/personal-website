<h1>Describe Yo Self.</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;" class="row about-me">
  <div class="col-md-6">
  I would consider myself a former global nomad. Child to retired United States Foregin Service Officers, I lived overseas during my upbringing. Raised primarily in Southeast Asia, I got to experience my 'expat' life through hyper-american rosed colored glasses. I throw people off with my Bay Area accent, but I've lived most of my life on the streets of Jakarta or Singapore rather than Seattle.

  Main objective is to work in the beauty or fashion industry. Be very happy to be in a place where I can pursue my passion of beauty and health, whilist working in the tech industry. I find that these dominant companies have a lack of female exposure whilst they customers they cater to are female focused.<strong> Abusurd</strong>. Title I would love to achieve would be software engineer for Sephora.

  <p class="content col-md-6">Through my dates on tinder I have come to the realization that I am hard to categorize. Cheerleader, sorority girl, college debater, mascot wearing, loud, video gamer, with an obession for all things <strong>glitter</strong> &amp; <strong>pink</strong>.</p>

    <p class="content col-md-6">I was never meant to live this life, so I am exceptionally aware of the privilege &amp; opportunity I have been given to pursue this field. My original life trajectory was to live in some remote village in East Java, be a young mum and be in a heavily patriarchal society. Thus, I am happy that I have been adopted into the life I am in now.   </p>

  <h1>Meet My Family</h1>
  <p>Family Above Everything</p>
</div>


<p>My best friend is my Father: <strong>Greg Fergin</strong>. He's super shy and quiet, more aligns himself of a bookworm who enjoys to be the observer than the "do-er". That doesn't mean I don't take him to clubs, raves and after parties. Fair warning, whatever you tell me I will tell my daddy. So if you don't want a 64 year old to know intimate parts of your life, I would suggest to keep that to yourself.

<div class="well">Will, William, Leo, Big Guy, Bunny, Fergin, Fergs</div>

<p>This is my buddy and love of my life Will Fergin. Adopted from the same agency, we have the usual brother and sister dynamic. Will is uncommonly kind, generous, romantic, friendly, independent and loving. We actually don't know where he's originally from, he just got dropped from the stork and became the prince of the Fergin Family. Permenant resident in Sydney, Australia -- will is a true blue aussie. We've been together for six countries, multiple moves and new schools. I am truly happy he has found his <strong>home</strong> in the land down under</p>
